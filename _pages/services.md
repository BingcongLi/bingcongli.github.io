Student projects supervision
----
We do have projects for ETH master and bachelor students. The lastest ones can be found in [ODI student projects](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/ThesisProjects).

Here are some github projects from supervised theses. 

[[Example 1](https://github.com/lk-eg/Computationally-Efficient-SAM)]
