Student projects supervision
----
We do have projects for ETH master and bachelor students. 
The lastest ones can be found in [ODI student projects](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/ThesisProjects).
If you are interested the theoretical foundations of deep learning, feel free to get in touch.
Below are past projects I (co-)supervised that are published or under submission at conferences and workshops:

**Bachelor projects**
- Memory efficient LLM fine-tuning with [[ConMeZO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02757)] at AISTATS 2026.

**Master's projects**
- Provable benefits of weight normalization. Check the ICLR 2026 [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01175)].

**PhD projects**
- Handling architectural symmetries in LLM fine-tuning via [[RefLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18877)] at NeurIPS 2025.
- LLM fine-tuning with [[PoLAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03133)] at NeurIPS 2025.
