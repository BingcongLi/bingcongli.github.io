Student projects supervision
----
We do have projects for ETH master and bachelor students. 
The lastest ones can be found in [ODI student projects](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/ThesisProjects).
If you are interested in optimization and the theoretical foundations of deep learning, feel free to get in touch.
Below are past projects I (co-)supervised that are published or under submission at conferences and workshops:

**Bachelor projects**
- Memory efficient LLM fine-tuning with [[ConMeZO](https://github.com/lk-eg/Computationally-Efficient-SAM)]

**Master's projects**
- In preparation for some conferences. Details to be released soon.

**PhD projects**
- Improved optimization for LLM fine-tuning with [[RefLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18877)]
- LLM fine-tuning with [[PoLAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03133)]
