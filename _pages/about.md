Welcome, it's a pleasure to connect with you! I'm Bingcong Li, a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich collaborating with [Prof. Niao He](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/niaohe) and the [ODI group](https://odi.inf.ethz.ch/). Prior to this, I received doctoral degree from the University of Minnesota under the supervision of [Prof. Georgios B. Giannakis](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/giannakis/home), and then I gained industry experience, dedicating a year to LLMs.

General interests
-----------


Computation is at the heart of modern AI and the invisible engine behind the success of LLMs.
The overarching goal of my research is to **make computation in the era of LLMs efficient, accessible, and affordable across heterogeneous resources**, from clusters with thousands of GPUs to users with consumer-grade hardware. My research draws on interdisciplinary tools from *deep learning*, *optimization*, and *signal processing* to tackle challenges across multiple scales of computation. At every stage, I develop theoretically grounded methods so that the resulting systems are more explainable. I focus on three questions:


- **Foundations of computing**: Which architectures and training strategies deliver the best accuracy and efficiency?
- **Scaling computation up**: How do we sustain throughput, reliability, and cost efficiency at the scale of thousands of GPUs?
- **Personalization**: How can we empower individuals and organizations with limited resources to access and benefit from modern AI?


I enjoy cycling 🚴🏻 outside offices. I also do a bit gym training, but ocationally people tell me my triceps pushdown techniques could use some work.
